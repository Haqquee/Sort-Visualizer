# Sort Visualizer
## Description
A Sort Algorithm Visualizer created using C++ and SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). The project uses graphics to show how some common sorting algorithms work step-by-step, and their efficiencies.

## Features
Currently, the visualizer can do the following:

1. Generate a random array of fixed size
2. Use Selection Sort
2. Use Bubble Sort
2. Use Insertion Sort

*I will be making further additions to the project and implementing more sorting algorithms (they are fairly simple to implement. Just need to add in the sorting algorithm and the graphics will be handled by the functions that I already created)

## Run the App
The project can be easily run through the exe file found in the latest release. Just download all the files and run the exe:
